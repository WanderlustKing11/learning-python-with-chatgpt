## Learning Python from ChatGPT ##

I'm using ChatGPT to teach me the basics of Python in the shortest amount of time possible. I'm aiming at about 2 hours. I have everything installed already. At the end I will take an assessment and see how I do.

The material I am aiming to cover includes:
- Syntax and Basic Constructs
- Control Structures
- Data Structures
- Functions
- Basic I/O
- Error Handling
- Pythonic Concepts
